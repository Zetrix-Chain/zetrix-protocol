# Introduction

## What is Non Fungible Token

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique cryptographic token that represents ownership of specific digital or physical assets on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, NFTs are indivisible and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis due to their distinctive characteristics. Each NFT is one-of-a-kind and includes specific metadata that sets it apart from other tokens. NFTs are utilized across various industries, enabling creators to tokenize and monetize their work, including art, music, videos, virtual real estate, collectibles, and more. Ownership and transaction records of NFTs are securely stored on the blockchain using smart contracts, ensuring transparency and authenticity. NFT marketplaces facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of these tokens, allowing collectors and investors to participate in the growing digital asset ecosystem.

## What is ZTP-721

ZTP-721 is the standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs). This interface enables users to perform actions such as minting, transferring, and burning tokens. By adopting this default standard, contracts utilizing ZTP-721 can seamlessly integrate with various services across the network.

# Token Definition
Note: Token definitions are defined when the token contract is deployed.
- **name**: Token name e.g. "Global Coin"
- **symbol**: Token symbol e.g. "GCN"
- **describe**: Token description e.g. "Global coin token issued by XYZ"
- **protocol**: Token protocol
- **version**: Token version
- **issuer**: Token issuer address

# Use Case

## Digital Art and Collectibles
Artists and creators could tokenize their artwork and collectibles as ZTP721 tokens, allowing them to prove ownership, authenticity, and scarcity. Platforms on the ZETRIX blockchain could facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of digital art and collectibles as ZTP721 tokens.

## Gaming and Virtual Real Estate
ZTP721 tokens could be used in the gaming industry to represent in-game assets, characters, and virtual real estate. Games built on the ZETRIX blockchain could leverage ZTP721 tokens to create unique, tradable assets within their virtual worlds, allowing players to buy, sell, and trade in-game items and properties.

## Tokenized Real-World Assets
The ZTP721 standard could be used to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, luxury goods, and collectible items on the ZETRIX blockchain. By representing these assets as NFTs (ZTP721 tokens), ownership could be easily transferred, fractional ownership could be established, and the provenance of the asset could be verified, leading to increased liquidity and accessibility to traditional asset classes.

## Lending and Borrowing Platforms
TP721 tokens could be used to create digital event tickets and access passes on the ZETRIX blockchain, providing a secure and transparent way to manage ticket sales, prevent counterfeiting, and verify attendance. This could streamline the ticketing process, reduce fraud, and enhance the overall event experience for organizers and attendees.

## Digital Identity and Credentials
The ZTP721 standard could be used to create digital identities and credentials, such as academic diplomas, professional certifications, and personal identification documents on the ZETRIX blockchain. By storing these credentials as NFTs (ZTP721 tokens), individuals could have greater control over their personal data, share verifiable proofs of their achievements and qualifications, and easily transfer ownership of their credentials when necessary.

## Supply Chain and Provenance Tracking
ZTP721 tokens could be used to track the provenance and authenticity of goods throughout the supply chain on the ZETRIX blockchain. By creating NFTs for each product or batch of products, companies could monitor the movement and ownership of their goods, verify the authenticity of products, and combat counterfeit products effectively.

## Music and Intellectual Property Rights
Musicians, artists, and content creators could tokenize their music, artworks, and intellectual property rights as ZTP721 tokens on the ZETRIX blockchain. This would enable them to monetize their creations through the sale of NFTs, establish ownership and copyright protections, and receive royalties automatically whenever their works are resold or used by others.
