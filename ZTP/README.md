# ZTP

In addition to the user interface and developer API improvements, this proposal emphasizes the importance of establishing application-level standards and conventions. These guidelines will foster a more predictable and interoperable development environment within the Zetrix ecosystem. Imagine a world where developers can build applications with the confidence that they will interact seamlessly with other applications and smart contracts on the network. This is precisely what application-level standards aim to achieve.

One key area of focus within these standards is contract standards.  Contracts are the building blocks of the Zetrix blockchain, and ensuring consistency and interoperability across different contracts is crucial for a healthy ecosystem. A prime example of this is token standards. Tokens are digital assets that can represent various things like currencies, loyalty points, or even ownership of real-world assets.

The proposed ZTP-20 standard would define a common set of functionalities that all tokens on the Zetrix blockchain should adhere to. This standardization offers several advantages:

Usability: By following the ZTP-20 standard, developers can create tokens with predictable behavior, making them easier for users to understand and interact with. Imagine sending a ZTP-20 token from one application to another, knowing it will be received and processed seamlessly.
Composability: Standardized tokens can be easily integrated into other applications and smart contracts built on the Zetrix blockchain. This fosters innovation and allows developers to leverage existing token functionalities within their own creations. Imagine building a decentralized exchange where any ZTP-20 token can be traded effortlessly.
Overall, application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards like ZTP-20, will play a critical role in creating a more unified and user-friendly Zetrix blockchain ecosystem. They empower developers to build with confidence, while ensuring a smooth and consistent experience for users interacting with various applications and tokenized assets on the network.
