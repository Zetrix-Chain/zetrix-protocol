# Introduction

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain, like cryptocurrency. These certificates can represent ownership of digital assets like artwork, music, or even virtual game items, and unlike money (fungible), each NFT is one-of-a-kind, allowing them to be bought, sold, or traded like rare collectibles.

## What is ZTP-1155

The ZTP1155 token standard is a multi-token standard developed for the ZETRIX blockchain. It was proposed as an improvement to the existing token standards to address some of their limitations and to provide more flexibility and efficiency for creating and managing both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within a single smart contract.

Here are some key characteristics and features of the ZTP1155 token standard:

- **Efficiency:** Unlike traditional token standards, which require separate smart contracts for each token type (fungible or non-fungible), ZTP1155 allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract. This results in reduced gas costs and improved scalability, as multiple token types can be managed and transferred more efficiently.

- **Batch Transfers:** ZTP1155 supports batch transfers, enabling multiple tokens to be sent in a single transaction. This feature is particularly beneficial for applications like gaming, where players may need to transfer multiple in-game items or assets simultaneously.

- **Flexible Token Types:** ZTP1155 supports a wide range of token types, including both fungible tokens (similar to ZTP-20) and non-fungible tokens (similar to ZTP-721). This flexibility allows developers to create diverse and complex token ecosystems with various token classes and properties.

- **Reduced Contract Complexity:** By consolidating multiple token types into a single smart contract, ZTP1155 simplifies the development and management of token contracts, reducing the complexity and potential risks associated with deploying and maintaining multiple contracts.

- **Interoperability:** ZTP1155 tokens are fully compatible with existing ZETRIX infrastructure, wallets, and decentralized applications (dApps), allowing for seamless integration and interoperability within the broader ZETRIX ecosystem.

- **Innovative Use Cases:** The flexibility and efficiency of ZTP1155 have enabled the development of innovative use cases and applications across various industries, including gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), digital collectibles, tokenized assets, and more.

# Token Definition
Note: Token definitions are defined when the token contract is deployed.

- **name**: Token name e.g. "Global Coin"
- **symbol**: Token symbol e.g. "GCN"
- **describe**: Token description e.g. "Global coin token issued by XYZ"
- **protocol**: Token protocol
- **version**: Token version
- **issuer**: Token issuer address

# Use Case

## Multi-Item Transactions
In gaming, players often need to manage multiple in-game items, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. ZTP-1155 tokens allow for batch transfers, enabling players to send or receive multiple items in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.

## Collectible Series
Artists and creators can release limited-edition collectible series as ERC-1155 tokens, each representing a unique piece of digital art or collectible. Collectors can buy, sell, and trade these digital assets on various platforms, creating a vibrant and decentralized marketplace for digital collectibles.

## Unlockable Content
Content creators can use ERC-1155 tokens to distribute unlockable digital content, such as exclusive artworks, music tracks, or digital publications. Owners of the tokens can access and download the content, providing a novel way to distribute and monetize digital creations.

## Supply Chain and Provenance Tracking
ERC-1155 tokens can streamline supply chain operations by automating inventory management, order processing, and logistics tracking, reducing costs, and improving efficiency.
