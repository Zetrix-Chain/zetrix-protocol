# Introduction

A token standard is a set of rules and specifications that define how a particular type of token should be created, transferred, and managed on a blockchain platform. These standards ensure interoperability, consistency, and security across different tokens built on the same blockchain.

These token standards provide a foundation for developers to create tokens that are compatible with various decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and other blockchain-based projects. By adhering to these standards, tokens can be easily integrated, traded, and managed across different platforms and ecosystems.

# What is the Token Standard

ZTP-20 is the standard interface for Fungible tokens. This interface enables users to perform actions such as minting and transferring tokens. By adopting this default standard, contracts utilizing ZTP-20 can seamlessly integrate with various services across the network.

# What is ZTP-20

ZTP-20 is the standard interface for Fungible tokens. This interface enables users to perform actions such as minting and transferring tokens. By adopting this default standard, contracts utilizing ZTP-20 can seamlessly integrate with various services across the network.

# Token definition
Note: Token definitions are defined when the token contract is deployed.
- **name**: Token name e.g. "Global Coin"
- **symbol**: Token symbol e.g. "GCN"
- **describe**: Token description: "Global coin token issued by XYZ"
- **decimals**: Token's decimal places
- **version**: Token version
- **protocol**: Token protocol
- **supply**: Token supply
- **issuer**: Token issuer address

# Use Case

## Utility Tokens

Projects could issue ZTP20 tokens as utility tokens to provide access to specific services or features within their platforms. For example, a decentralized application (dApp) could use ZTP20 tokens to grant users access to premium features or content.

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins like ZTether (ZUSD) or ZCoin (ZC) could be created as ZTP20 tokens pegged to the value of fiat currencies or other assets. These stablecoins could be used for trading, remittances, and as a store of value within the ZETRIX ecosystem due to their price stability.

## Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

ZTP20 tokens could be the primary assets traded on decentralized exchanges built on the ZETRIX blockchain. Users could trade ZTP20 tokens directly from their ZETRIX wallets without the need for intermediaries, providing greater control and privacy over their assets.

## Lending and Borrowing Platforms

DeFi platforms on the ZETRIX blockchain could allow users to lend and borrow ZTP20 tokens using smart contracts. These platforms could utilize ZTP20 tokens as collateral for loans, enabling users to earn interest on their deposits or borrow assets against their holdings.

## Tokenized Assets and Securities

ZTP20 tokens could be used to represent tokenized assets, such as real estate, commodities, and traditional securities like stocks and bonds. These tokenized assets could be traded and transferred on the ZETRIX blockchain, providing increased liquidity and accessibility to traditional asset classes.
