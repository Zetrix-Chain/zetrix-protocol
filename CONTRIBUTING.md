# How to Contribute to a Zetrix Project

Your contributions to the Zetrix network will help improve the worldâ€™s financial infrastructure, faster.

We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute changes that help the Zetrix network grow and thrive. There are a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow so that we can merge your changes quickly.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
2. Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
    - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
3. Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Minor Changes
### Documentation
For small changes to comments and documentation, it is not always necessary to create a new GitHub issue. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit with 'doc' instead of an issue number.

## Finding Things to Work On
The first place to start is always looking over the current GitHub issues for the project you are interested in contributing to. Issues marked with help wanted are usually pretty self-contained and a good place to get started.

If you see any issues that are assigned to a particular person or have the in progress label, that means someone is currently working on that issue this issue in the next week or two.

Of course, feel free to create a new issue if you think something needs to be added or fixed.

## Making Changes
1. Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    - This is usually the master branch.
    - Please avoid working directly on the master branch.
2. Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes and make sure all tests pass.

## Submitting Changes
1. All content, comments, pull requests, and other contributions must comply with the Zetrix Code of Conduct.
2. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
3. Submit a pull request to the docs repository in the Zetrix organization.
    - Include a descriptive commit message.
    - Changes contributed via pull request should focus on a single issue at a time.
4. Rebase your local changes against the master branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives.
