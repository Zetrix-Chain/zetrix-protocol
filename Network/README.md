# Network
This proposal outlines the development of a secure and scalable data storage network for the Zetrix ecosystem. The current network struggles to handle the ever-growing volume of data, leading to slow access times and potential bottlenecks. This new network will utilize a distributed ledger technology to ensure data security and integrity, while also implementing a sharding architecture to distribute data storage across multiple nodes, significantly increasing scalability. By implementing this network, we aim to enhance the overall user experience within the Zetrix ecosystem by providing faster data access times and a more reliable infrastructure. This proposal details the technical specifications, implementation timeline, and the team's qualifications to bring this vital improvement to the Zetrix ecosystem.
