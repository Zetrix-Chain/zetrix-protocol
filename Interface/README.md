# Interface

This proposal details the creation of a user-friendly interface for the Zetrix blockchain. Currently, interacting with the blockchain might require technical knowledge or specific tools, limiting accessibility for the broader user base. This new interface aims to bridge that gap by providing a user-centric platform for interacting with the Zetrix blockchain. Imagine a platform that allows users to easily monitor transactions, manage their digital assets, and participate in network activities without needing extensive blockchain expertise. This proposal outlines the design principles, development roadmap, and team responsible for crafting this intuitive interface, ultimately aiming to empower a wider audience to seamlessly engage with the Zetrix blockchain ecosystem.
