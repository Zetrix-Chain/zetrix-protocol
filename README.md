# What is ZEP :
Zetrix Ecosystem Proposals (ZEPs) describe standards for the Zetrix platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.
ZEPs define standards for building infrastructure on top of the Zetrix network. They are designed to help different entities, such as asset issuers, wallets, exchanges, and other service providers interoperate using a single common integration.

# What is the difference between ZEP and ZTP?
ZEP is the ecosystem proposal that can cover; Core, Network, Interface, ZTP and Information. Whereas, ZTP is the application level standard which is a type under ZEP. ZTP includes contract standards such as token standards (ZTP-20) and Non-Fungible Token Standard (ZTP-721)

The adoption of ZEP is almost equivalent to EIP in Ethereum or SEP in Stellar. ZEP was introduced as a tracking mechanism for Zetrix improvement.
Normally, ZEP is created by the internal team since Zetrix is currently not a community-driven network.

# Structure of a ZEP

A ZEP typically follows a well-defined structure, allowing for clear communication and efficient decision-making. Here's a general outline:

1. **ZEP Number (ZEP-XX):** Each ZEP is assigned a unique identifier (XX) for easy referencing.
2. **Title:** A concise and informative title that accurately reflects the ZEP's subject matter.
3. **Abstract:** A brief overview of the ZEP's purpose and key points.
4. **Author(s):** Individual or team responsible for submitting the ZEP.
5. **Status:** The current development stage of the ZEP (e.g., Draft, Proposed, Implemented).
6. **Motivation:** This section explains the rationale behind the ZEP. It might identify a specific design issue within the Zetrix blockchain, highlight potential areas for improvement, or introduce relevant information for the community's consideration.
7. **Specification:** The core of the ZEP dives into the specifics of the proposal. Depending on the ZEP's nature, this section might outline technical details, propose best practices, or share informative content for developers and users.
8. **Rationale:** This section provides justification for the proposed solution or approach within the ZEP. It should clearly explain the benefits and potential impact on the Zetrix ecosystem.
9. **Backwards Compatibility:** If the ZEP introduces changes that might affect existing applications or workflows, this section details how backward compatibility will be maintained or addressed.
10. **Security Considerations:** Any security implications of the ZEP's proposal should be outlined and addressed in this section.
11. **Implementation:** This section (optional) can provide details on the implementation plan for the ZEP, if applicable.
12. **Open Issues:** Here, the author(s) can identify any outstanding questions or areas that require further discussion within the community.
13. **References:** A list of any external resources or relevant documentation is included for further reference.
