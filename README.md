# What is ZEP :
Zetrix Ecosystem Proposals (ZEPs) describe standards for the Zetrix platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.
ZEPs define standards for building infrastructure on top of the Zetrix network. They are designed to help different entities, such as asset issuers, wallets, exchanges, and other service providers interoperate using a single common integration.

# What is the difference between ZEP and ZTP?
ZEP is the ecosystem proposal that can cover; Core, Network, Interface, ZTP and Information. Whereas, ZTP is the application level standard which is a type under ZEP. ZTP includes contract standards such as token standards (ZTP-20) and Non-Fungible Token Standard (ZTP-721)

The adoption of ZEP is almost equivalent to EIP in Ethereum or SEP in Stellar. ZEP was introduced as a tracking mechanism for Zetrix improvement.
Normally, ZEP is created by the internal team since Zetrix is currently not a community-driven network.
